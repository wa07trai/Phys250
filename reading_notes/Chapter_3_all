## Euler Method & Euler-Cromer Method of Approximation for SHM

In a program ultilizing the euler method of approximation for SHM with multiple periods, the program will begin to produce errors of increasing magnitude.
As t continues, the amplitude and energy of the system will increase continuously.
The reason for this behavior stems from the way the system is coded. Firstly consider the eqution: $\frac{\omega}{dt}=-\frac{g}{l}*{\theta}
